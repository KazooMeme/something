    I've added a couple of metatags here. You don't need to worry too much about these but they're 
    quite commonly used, so I thought I'd demonstrate them. The ones that start `og:` in particular, are
    used by Facebook, when you paste a link into your post and it shows a little preview of the webpage,
    it's getting the information from these metatags. OG stands for "Open Graph", you don't need to, but you
    can read more about it here: https://ogp.me/

    It's a convention/best practice to include your site name in the title, and to use `-` as a separator.

    Ok, so this is where the content of our site actually starts. I've added in a load of "semantic HTML".
    - `<article>` is a tag that basically declares it's contents are a self-contained work. Everything within an
      article tag should relate to the same topic/heading.
    - An `article` is made up of 3 bits here: 'header', 'main' and 'footer'. You don't have to use these within an
      article exclusively, but this is a common structure.
    - `<header>` - This will typically the main navigation of the site, and sometimes some content like a banner.
    - `<main>` - fairly self-explanatory, all the main content of the page goes in here.
    - `<footer>` - most sites have a footer, it normally contains some links off to other pages, maybe some small-print 
      copyright information etc.
  -->
  <article>
    <header>
      <!--
        the `<nav>` tag should be used for navigation. The navigation items themselves are a list of links,
        so that's reflected in the markup. The `aria-label` attribute is an a11y thing. There are loads of
        `aria` attributes you can put on your HTML tags to help with accessibility. This is a good thing to
        be aware of, but not something you need to take a deep-dive on just yet. If you're interested, you
        can read a bit more here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA

        <ul>
          <!--
            you'll notice clicking on these links in the browser doesn't work at the moment. We'll need
            to "host" our project first. We'll look at this next, once we're confident with the basic HTML
            and CSS that we've got going on here.
